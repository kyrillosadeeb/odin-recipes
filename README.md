# Kiro's Recipes 
Kiro's recipes mark my first coded website in the Odin's project. Although I have some experience coding websites I would like to document the progress throughout this project and hence I will be keeping it in html. 

I might add some recipes too later as I feel this website fits me as I love to cook and would like to share some recipes of my own. 

This will definitely won't be the final version and I will be soon linking here the latest styled, animated and interactive cooking website here.
